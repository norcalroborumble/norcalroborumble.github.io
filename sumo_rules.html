            [Definition] A match is fought between two teams, each team having one or more contestants. Only one team member may approach the ring; other team members must watch from the audience. In accordance with the game rules (hereafter referred to as "these rules",) each team competes on a Dohyo (sumo ring) with a robot that they have constructed themselves to the specifications in Section 3. The match starts at the judge's command and continuous until a contestant earns two Yuhkoh points. The judge determines the winner of the match.</p>

    <p>1. The ring shall be circular in shape and of the appropriate dimensions for the given size class.</p>

        <p>3. <b>Autonomous classes:</b> Nano (25g), Micro (100g), Mini (500g), Lego (1kg), and Mega (3kg) robots must be autonomous.   Any method of control may be used, as long as it is fully contained within the robot and recieves no external signals or directions (human, machine, or otherwise).  Autonomous robot operation must begin automatically no less than five seconds after being started by the user.  Robots starting before the five second mark forfeit that Yuhkoh point.
        <p>
            4.  <b>Remote controlled classes:</b> 3kg R/C and Humanoid class robots can be remotely controlled in accordance to FCC regulations, and regulated by tournament officials.  75Mhz controllers are specifically prohibited.  All remote controls must be digitally-mated pairs.  Remote control robots start on a signal from the tournament official. <b>No augmented autonomous controls are allowed on the robot.  All robot motion must be directly due to the teleoperation of the operator. </b>
        <P>
            5. <b>Network class:</b>  3kg network controlled robots must be controlled via WiFi communication from the operators computer, via an intermediary router. Direct connections to and from the robot by the operator's controller/computer are prevented by the network configuration and not allowed. Both the operator and the robot will have open connections to the internet. The event will provide two WPA2 PSK secured routers, one for the controller and one for the robot, with publicly addressable IP addresses. Probable router model will be Linksys WRT54GL. Participants should practice control through multiple routers both prior to and on arrival to the event. <b>No augmented autonomous controls are allowed on the robot.  All robot motion must be directly due to the teleoperation of the operator. </b>
        <P>


        <p>6. The robot must have a name or number for registration purposes. Display this name or number on your robot to allow spectators and officials to identify your robot.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Article 6</b> [Robot Restrictions]
        </p>
        <p>1. Jamming devices, such as IR LEDs intended to saturate the opponents IR sensors, are not allowed.</p>
        <p>2. Parts that could break or damage the ring are not allowed. Do not use parts that are intended to damage the opponents robot or it's operator. Normal pushes and bangs are not considered intent to damage.</p>
        <p>3. Devices that can store liquid, powder, gas or other substances for throwing at the opponent are not allowed. </p>
        <p>4. Any flaming devices are not allowed.</p>
        <p>5. Devices that throw things at your opponent are not allowed.</p>
        <p>6. Sticky substances to improve traction are not allowed. Tires and other components of the robot in contact with the ring must not be able to pick up and hold a standard 3"x5" index card for more than two seconds.</p>
        <p>7. Devices to increase down force, such as a vacuum pump or magnets, are only allowed in the 3 kg class.  They are not allowed in all other classes.</p>
        <p>8. All edges, including but not limited to the front scoop, must not be sharp enough to scratch or damage the ring, other robots, or players. In general, edges with a radius of greater than .005", as would be obtained with a unsharpened .010" thick metal strip, should be ok. Judges or competition officials may require edges that they deem too sharp to be covered with a piece of tape.</p>

        <p>2. The team who wins two rounds or receives two "Yuhkoh" points first, within the time limit, shall win the match. A team receives a "Yuhkoh" point when they win a round. If the time limit is reached before one team can get two "Yuhkoh" points, and one of the teams has received one Yuhkoh point, the team with one Yuhkoh point shall win.</p>
        <p>3. When the match is not won by either team within the time limit, an extended match may be fought, during which the team who receives the first Yuhkoh point shall win. Alternatively, the winner/loser of the match may be decided by judges, by means of lots, or by a rematch.</p>

(A robot or a part of a robot may not be placed beyond the front edge of the Shikiri line toward the opponent. Note that is not required that a robot be placed directly behind the Shikiri line; it may be offset to the side, as long as it is behind an imaginary line collinear with the Shikiri line.) When the judge announces the start of the round, the teams start their robots, and after a five second pause the robots may start operating. During these five seconds, players must clear out of the ring area.</p>
        <p><b>Article 9</b> [Stop, Resume] The match stops and resumes when a judge announces so.</p>

            <li type="A">Both robots move, without making progress, or stop (at the exact same time) and stay stopped for five seconds without touching each other. However, if one robot stops it's movement first, after five seconds it will be declared as not having the will to fight. In this case the opponent shall receive a Yuhkoh, even if the opponent also stops. If both robots are moving and it isn't clear if progress is being made or not, the judge can extend the time limit up to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li type="A">If both robots touch the outside of the ring at about the same time, and it can not be determined which touched first, a rematch is called. </li>
