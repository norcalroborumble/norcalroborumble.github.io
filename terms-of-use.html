        <p>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
        <p>The Terms, and your relationship with MakerHQ under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and MakerHQ agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of Sacramento, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms or between you and MakerHQ. Notwithstanding this, you agree that MakerHQ shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. At not time shall you ever be entitled to seek or obtain equitable or injunctive relief.</p>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MakerHQ and its officers, directors, owners, and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, liability, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by any of them in connection with any use or alleged use of the Service by any person.</p>
